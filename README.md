# Flixster
In this project you will be building an Android app that gets the latest movies currently playing in theaters -- similar to Fandango and Rotten Tomatoes -- and lets a user view and scroll through a list of movies. To do this, you'll learn how to get data from the internet (via an API) and display it in a scrollable list in your app.
